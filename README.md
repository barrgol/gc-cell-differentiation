# Cell Differentiation in Germinal Center

Code partially reproduces the results presented in "Quantitative modeling of the terminal differentiation of B cells and mechanisms of lymphomagenesis" (Martinez et al., 2012). This repository serves as the baseline for the project done as the main part of the Bioinformatics II course @ University of Amsterdam, 2023-2024.

`notebook.ipynb` is the main part of this repo & contains the experiments, analysis and the related figures.

`GCExitPathwayModel.py` and `CD40Subnetwork.py` contain the two corresponding ODE models for B-cell differentiation in the germinal center as presented in the original paper by Martinez et al.
